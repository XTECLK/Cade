# Getting started

Self-host Cade for your team: one Cloudflare Worker, one Slack app, and an
optional Google Sheet. There is no server to run; Cade keeps its tasks in
a Cloudflare D1 database that comes with the Worker, and shows them in Slack
(and your Sheet, if you add one).

## The quick way

From the cloned folder (step 1), run:

```sh
npm run setup
```

It takes you through steps 2 to 8 below: Cloudflare login, the Worker, the
Slack app, optionally Google Sheets and Docs, then your first group. It
pauses where a person has to click in a browser, skips what's done already,
and can be run again to carry on. Tokens and secrets are asked for by the
scripts it runs, hidden, and never stored in a file.

The steps below are the same thing by hand. Each says what to run, what you
should see, and what to do if it goes wrong. Steps marked **(person)** need
someone to click in a browser.

## What you need

- Node.js 20 or newer, and git.
- A Cloudflare account (the free plan is enough).
- A Slack workspace where you can create apps.
- Optional: a Google account, for the Sheet.

## Settings

Cade has two kinds of settings. **Config** is what you edit as your team
changes; it lives in `cade.config.json` on your machine (git ignores it) and
`npm run config` uploads it. **Secrets** give access to Slack or the Sheet;
they're set once with `npx wrangler secret put NAME` and live only in
Cloudflare, never in a file. Both take effect straight away and survive every
`npm run deploy`. `npx wrangler secret list` shows which are set (not their
values).

### Config: `cade.config.json`

| Key | Required? | What it is | How to get it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `projects` | **Required** | One entry per project, each with the settings in the next table. The project is a Slack channel where the team tracks its tasks and incidents, optionally with its own Google Doc and Sheet. | `npm run group` (step 8), or write them by hand. |
| `timezone` | Optional (UTC) | The time zone for the Sheet's **Tracked at** and **Completed at** times, as an IANA name such as `Asia/Colombo`. With `ai` on, it's also how "Friday" or "tomorrow" in a message becomes a due date. | `npm run group` asks for it the first time (step 8). Your team's time zone; [the list of names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). |
| `googleUrl` | Optional | The Google web app's URL (`https://script.google.com/…/exec`), one for every project's Sheet and Doc. Without it, nothing is written to Google, and `/cade brief` and `/cade debrief` don't work. | Set for you by `npm run google:create` (step 7). |

Each entry in `projects` takes these. Nothing else is set at the top of the file: the settings below belong to a project, so two projects can differ.

| Key | Required? | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | **Required** | The project's name, as `/cade brief acme` and the project picker show it. |
| `channel` | **Required** | The project's Slack channel ID, where the team tracks its tasks and incidents: open the channel → click its name → **About** → **Channel ID** at the bottom (`C…`). `npm run group` makes or finds it for you. |
| `doc` | Optional | The address of the project's Google Doc, where `/cade brief` writes its executive summaries. |
| `sheet` | Optional | The address of the project's own Google Sheet for its tasks. Without it, its tasks aren't recorded in a Sheet. |
| `taskStatusChangeDetection` | Optional (`true`) | **The proactive agent**: whether Cade reads messages in the threads it manages (task and incident threads) and offers, privately, to act on them: a pasted PR link, a hand-off ("@mia can you review this?"), "on it", "lgtm" or "done", and, with `ai`, a priority or due date. Each comes as one private message to whoever wrote it, with **Accept**, **Edit…** and **Reject**; nothing changes until then. `false` is **commands only**: nothing is read from messages in threads, while slash and `@Cade` commands, the task card's ⋯ menu, message shortcuts and emoji still work. |
| `newMessageTaskDetection` | Optional (`true`) | **Task detection from new messages**: whether Cade asks about a message posted on its own in the channel, not in a thread, so it can be turned into work: track it as a task, report it as an incident, or move it to an existing thread. `false` leaves such messages alone; the same can still be done with the emoji, the message shortcuts and `@Cade` commands. It is separate from `taskStatusChangeDetection`. |
| `aiSuggestions` | Optional (`false`) | **AI suggestions**: the proactive agent reads messages in a task's thread with [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) instead of by their phrases, so one message can change several roles, the status, the priority and the due date, and people can be removed ("take this over from @bob"). `true` or `false`. Needs `taskStatusChangeDetection` on. If the model fails or takes over 8 seconds, the message is read by its phrases instead. PR links are always read by their phrases. Uses the `AI` binding in `wrangler.toml`; Workers AI's usage beyond its free daily allowance is billed to your Cloudflare account. |
| `aiModel` | Optional | The Workers AI text model `aiSuggestions` uses, such as `"@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it"`. Without it, the default, `@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash`, the quickest and cheapest that read messages well in our tests. Does nothing unless `aiSuggestions` is `true`. |
| `activeTasksPinning` | Optional (`false`) | Whether open tasks are pinned in the channel (and unpinned when done, archived or moved). `true` to pin them (needs the `pins:write` permission); with `false`, pins are left alone, and tasks already pinned stay pinned. |
| `summaryCanvas` | Optional (`false`) | Whether the channel has a summary canvas of its tasks, kept up to date. `true` to keep one; with `false`, none is written and `/cade resync summary` says it is off, and a canvas already made stays as it is. |
| `exportOnDone` | Optional (`true`) | Whether a task's thread is written to the project's Google Doc when the task is done: a tab of its own under the Doc's **Export** tab, which the card then links as *Thread export*. Needs `doc`. `false` leaves it to the card's ⋯ → **Export thread** and `/cade export <link>`. Nothing is posted when it happens. |

Start from `cade.config.sample.json`, which lists every option; copy it to `cade.config.json`, keep what you need and delete the rest. `npm run config` checks the file
(names, channel IDs, time zone and URL) and uploads nothing until it's right.

To add or change a group without editing the file, `npm run group` takes
you through it: the group's name, then each channel (a new one, which Cade
makes and is then in, or one that exists: a public one Cade joins itself, a
private one once you send `/invite @Cade` in it), people to add to them by
email or member ID, and, once the Google web app is set up (step 7), the
group's Doc and Sheet. It says what it will do before doing it, then saves
and uploads the file. It asks for Cade's bot token (or takes
`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`), and needs the app's channel permissions (`npm run
slack:update`, then reinstall the app, if it was made before them).

Or give the settings at once:

```sh
npm run group -- --name acme --channel C… --doc new --sheet new
```

`--doc` and `--sheet` take
`new` (made for you, named "acme executive summaries" and "acme tasks") or
`none` to unlink; leave them out to keep what the group has. It checks and
uploads the file, as `npm run config` does.

### Secrets: in Cloudflare only

| Secret | Required? | What it is | How to get it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | **Required** | Lets Cade check that requests really come from Slack. | Set for you by `npm run slack:create` (step 5). Otherwise: the app's page at <https://api.slack.com/apps> → **Basic Information** → **App Credentials** → **Signing Secret**. |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | **Required** | Lets Cade read and post as the app (`xoxb-…`). | After installing the app (step 6): its page → **OAuth & Permissions** → **Bot User OAuth Token**. `npm run slack:create` asks for it and stores it. |
| `GOOGLE_SECRET` | Only with `googleUrl` | Stops anyone else using your Google web app. | Generated and set for you by `npm run google:create` (step 7), which also puts it in `google/Secret.gs` for the script. |

### Used once during setup, never stored

| Credential | What it's for | How to get it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloudflare login | Deploying, setting secrets and creating the database with `wrangler`. | `npx wrangler login` (step 2), or an API token with **Workers Scripts → Edit** and **D1 → Edit** in `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. |
| Google login | Creating or updating the Google web app (`npm run google:create`, `google:update`). | `npx clasp login` (step 7). |
| App configuration token | Creating or updating the Slack app (`npm run slack:create`, `slack:update`), which ask for it, hidden. | <https://api.slack.com/apps> → **Your App Configuration Tokens** → **Generate Token** (`xoxe.xoxp-…`); it lasts 12 hours. Step 4. |

`npm run dev` (see [README.md](README.md)) uses the same config file and asks for the
secrets each time, without saving them.

## 1. Get the code

Copy Cade to your own GitHub account first (person): on its GitHub page,
click **Fork**, or **Use this template** for a copy without its history.
Your copy is what you deploy, and where you pull updates into later. Then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<your copy>.git cade
cd cade
npm install
npm test
```

**Expect:** `npm test` ends with `fail 0`.

## 2. Log in to Cloudflare (person)

```sh
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler whoami
```

`wrangler login` opens a browser to approve access. **Expect:** `whoami`
prints your account name and ID. **If it fails:** run `npx wrangler login`
again; on a machine without a browser, use an API token instead
(`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, with **Workers Scripts → Edit**).

**If `whoami` lists several accounts**, give the one for Cade once, with any
npm script: `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<its ID> npm run deploy`. It's saved to
`.cade/cloudflare.json` (kept out of git), and every npm script uses it from then
on.

## 3. Name and deploy the Worker

In `wrangler.toml`, set `name` (for example `cade`). It must be unique in
your Cloudflare account, and becomes part of the URL.

All other settings are Worker secrets, set in later steps, so nothing else
in the file needs changing.

```sh
npm run deploy
```

The first deploy also creates the database Cade keeps its tasks in, named
after the Worker (`cade-db`), then its tables; there's nothing to copy into
`wrangler.toml`. Wrangler asks you to confirm before creating the tables.

**Expect:** a URL such as `https://cade.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`, then
`0001_tasks_and_requirements.sql` listed with ✅. Note the URL: it's the
**Worker URL**. On a new account, Wrangler first asks you to choose your
`workers.dev` subdomain. **If the tables step fails** (for example, the
connection drops), run `npm run db:migrate`.

## 4. Get a Slack app configuration token (person)

Open <https://api.slack.com/apps>, scroll to **Your App Configuration
Tokens**, and **Generate Token** for your workspace. Copy the **Access
Token** (`xoxe.xoxp-…`). It lasts 12 hours; generate a new one when needed.

## 5. Create the Slack app

```sh
npm run slack:create -- https://cade.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

Options: `--name "Acme Cade"` (default `Cade`, up to 35 characters) and
`--command /acme` (default `/cade`).

The app's name doesn't need to be unique across Slack, since it isn't
published to the marketplace; every team can call theirs Cade. If you run two
copies in one workspace (say a test copy), give them different names and
commands, because a workspace can't have two `/cade` commands. Cade's help
text always says `/cade`, so keep the default unless you need two copies.

The script creates the app from `slack/manifest.json` (scopes, events,
Interactivity and the slash command, all pointing at your Worker), stores the
signing secret in the Worker, then turns on Event Subscriptions.

**Expect:** `Created app A…`, wrangler confirming the secret, then an install
link. The app's ID is saved in `.cade/slack-app.json` (not committed).
**If it fails:**
- `invalid_auth` or `token_expired`: get a new token (step 4).
- Turning on Event Subscriptions fails: check `npm run deploy` succeeded,
  then run `npm run slack:update`.

## 6. Install the app and store the bot token (person)

Open the install link the script printed and **Allow**. Then, in the app's
**OAuth & Permissions** page, copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`)
and paste it when the script asks. If you skipped that:

```sh
npx wrangler secret put SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
```

## 7. Optional: Google Sheets and Docs

Each group can have its own Google Sheet, a record of every task (Slack's
free plan keeps 90 days of history), and its own Google Doc, where `/cade
brief` writes executive summaries to go through with the client and
`/cade debrief` reads back what was added. One web app serves them all. It
needs a Google account.

1. **(person)** `npx clasp login`, and turn on the Apps Script API at
   <https://script.google.com/home/usersettings> (once per account).
2. Create the web app:

   ```sh
   npm run google:create
   ```

   **Expect:** a standalone script, "Cade_<your Slack workspace>", deployed as a web app; the
   Worker gets its address (`googleUrl`, in `cade.config.json` and
   uploaded) and its secret (`GOOGLE_SECRET`).
3. **(person)** Open the script link it prints, choose `authorize`, click
   **Run** and allow it.

Each group's Doc and Sheet are made when you set the group up (step 8). The
script needs Google's `documents` and `spreadsheets` access (the Docs and
Sheets services won't run on `drive.file` alone). It only touches the files
the Worker names. Skip this step for now and add them
later with `npm run group`.

**If it fails** with the Apps Script API: turn it on (step 1) and run it
again. Details, doing it by hand, and troubleshooting are in
[google/README.md](google/README.md).

## 8. Set up your first group (person)

A **group** is a team or project, with its own **dev** channel (for example
`#acme-dev`), where the team tracks its work: tasks with `/cade task`,
setting each one's priority and due date, and incidents with `/cade
incident`, always urgent and due immediately. Messages from anywhere else,
a client's shared channel or a DM included, become tasks or incidents, or
move into one, with the message shortcuts (⋯ → **More actions**); outside
the dev channel, with more than one group, they ask which project, as
groups are called there.

`npm run group` takes you through it. It asks questions, so run it in a
terminal window of your own, in this folder:

```sh
npm run group
```

1. Cade's bot token, hidden: the `xoxb-…` token from step 6 (or set
   `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` first, to skip the question).
2. The group's name, then your team's time zone (the first time only).
3. The dev channel, **existing or new**: an existing channel by its ID
   (the channel's name → **About** → **Channel ID**, `C…`), which Cade joins
   if it's public, or waits for `/invite @Cade` in it if it's private; or a
   new one by name, which Cade makes, public or private, and is then in.
4. People to add to the channel, by email or Slack member ID.
5. With the Google web app (step 7), whether to turn on the group's Google
   Doc and Google Sheet. Cade makes them.
6. What it will do, to confirm. It then does it, saves the group in
   `cade.config.json` (git ignores it) and uploads it as the Worker secrets
   `CHANNEL_PAIRS` and `TIMEZONE`.

**Expect:** "Done", with the channel's link. Then share the group's Doc
with the client as **Editor**, if you go through its summaries with them.

Run `npm run group` again for every other group, or to change one: Enter
keeps what it has. To set the first group up later, skip this step and run
it when you're ready. Editing `cade.config.json` by hand and running `npm
run config` works too (see [Settings](#settings)).

## 9. Check it works

1. In any channel: `/cade help` → only you see the command list.
2. In the dev channel: `/cade task` → a form; submitting posts the task.
3. In the task's thread: `@Cade status in progress` → ✅ on your message. A typed
   command gets a ✅ rather than a message in the thread; changes made from
   the card's ⋯ → **Edit**, or by accepting a suggestion, are posted there
   once, as a change log followed by what it asks of the people it names
   (see [notifications](https://xteclk.github.io/Cade/notifications.html)).
4. In the same thread: `@Cade assign owner @someone` → ✅, and the thread asks
   them to pick it up. Then write a message such as "@someone can you review
   this?" → only you see a summary with **Accept**, **Edit…** and **Reject**.
5. Open **Cade** under Apps in the sidebar → the **Home** tab lists your open
   tasks (**My Tasks**, **Unassigned**, **All Tasks**). If it's blank, run
   `npm run slack:update` and reinstall the app (step 6).
6. On any message, in a DM too: ⋯ → **More actions** → **New task** →
   the task form, with a **Project** picker if you have more than one group;
   submitting posts the task and copies the message into its thread.

**If nothing answers:** run `npx wrangler tail` and try again.
`Invalid signature` means the signing secret is wrong (rerun step 5 or
`wrangler secret put SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` with the one under **Basic
Information**); `not_in_channel` means the app isn't invited;
`missing_scope` means the app needs reinstalling (step 6).

## Updating

Bring Cade's changes into your copy with **Sync fork** on its GitHub page
(or `git pull https://github.com/XTECLK/Cade.git main`), then:

```sh
git pull
npm install
npm test
npm run deploy                              # also applies new files in migrations/
npm run slack:update                        # only if slack/manifest.json changed
npm run google:update                       # only if google/ changed
```

If Slack says the app needs reinstalling after an update, reinstall it from
the app's page (step 6); the bot token usually stays the same.

Groups no longer have a client or incidents channel: incidents are tracked
in the dev channel, and the message shortcuts (**New task**, **New
incident**, **Move to existing**) bring in messages from anywhere. After
updating, run `npm run slack:update` for the new shortcuts, and `npm run
group` once per group, which drops its old `external` and `incidents`
channels from `cade.config.json`. Requirements already in a client channel
are left as they were, and no longer tracked.

After updating, the **Home** tab and any new shortcuts or events come with
`npm run slack:update`; Slack may then ask you to reinstall the app.

## Limits to know

- Slack's free plan hides messages older than 90 days, including old tasks'
  threads. The tasks themselves stay in the database (and the Sheet).
- D1's free plan allows 100,000 row writes a day and 500 MB per database;
  each change to a task is a single row write.
- If Slack won't take a new task or incident (for example
  while it is rate limiting), Cade keeps it and tries again every five
  minutes, five times in all, telling whoever made it the first time and if
  it gives up.
- Cade can only delete its own messages; people's replies stay.

## Good to know

- **The app icon.** Slack's manifest can't set an icon, so upload
  `slack/icon.png` (drawn from `slack/icon.svg`) under **Basic Information →
  Display Information** on the app's page at <https://api.slack.com/apps>.
- **Test channels.** Several channel groups can run at once (see
  [Settings](#settings)), so a test channel can sit alongside the real
  one.
- **Google Sheets and Docs**: each group's own spreadsheet records its
  tasks (filter its Status column to see completed ones), and its own doc
  holds its executive summaries. See [google/README.md](google/README.md);
  a group without `sheet` isn't recorded in a Sheet.

## Using Cade

Once it's set up, send `/cade help` in Slack for the short
list, and see the [commands guide](https://xteclk.github.io/Cade/commands.html)
for every command, where it works and what it does, and the
[notifications guide](https://xteclk.github.io/Cade/notifications.html) for who
is told what when a task changes.
