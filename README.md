# Cade

**C.A.D.E.**, the Central Assistant for Delivery & Execution, is a Slack
app for tracking a team's work, tasks and incidents, in its own channel.
Messages from anywhere in Slack, a DM included, can be made into tasks or
moved into one. It runs as a single Cloudflare Worker, with its tasks in a
D1 database.

- **Start here:** [the Cade website](https://xteclk.github.io/Cade/)
  shows what it does, [how to set it up](https://xteclk.github.io/Cade/setup.html)
  with an AI agent, and [every command](https://xteclk.github.io/Cade/commands.html).
- [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) is the step-by-step setup the
  agent follows, if you'd rather follow it yourself.
- This page is for working on the code.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm test        # the whole suite, in a few seconds, without Slack
npm run dev     # the Worker on this machine
npm run deploy  # the Worker on Cloudflare
```

`npm run dev` serves the Worker at `http://localhost:8787`, reloading as you
edit. It takes the channels, time zone and Sheet address from
`cade.config.json`, and asks for the secrets each time without saving them
(or takes them from the environment, such as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=… npm run
dev`). Slack can't reach `localhost`, so to try it against Slack, expose it
with a tunnel (such as `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8787`) and
create a separate app for it: `npm run slack:create -- <tunnel URL> --name
"Cade Dev" --command /cadedev`. Deploying to a pair of test channels is
often simpler.

Other scripts:

| Script | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run setup` | Takes you through the whole setup: Cloudflare, the Worker, the Slack app, optionally Google, then your first group |
| `npm run group` | Takes you through adding or changing a group: makes or links its Slack channels, adds people, can make its Doc and Sheet, then saves and uploads `cade.config.json`. With `-- --name acme --tasks C… [--doc new] [--sheet new]` it takes them at once |
| `npm run config` | Checks `cade.config.json` and uploads it as Worker secrets (`CHANNEL_PAIRS`, `TIMEZONE`, `GOOGLE_URL`) |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Applies `migrations/` to the deployed D1 database; `npm run deploy` does this after deploying, and `npm run dev` for the local one |
| `npm run slack:create -- <url>` | Creates the Slack app from `slack/manifest.json` |
| `npm run slack:update` | Applies `slack/manifest.json` to the app created above |
| `npm run google:create` | Creates the Google web app (each group's Sheet and Doc) with clasp, and gives the Worker its address and secret |
| `npm run google:update` | Pushes `google/` and redeploys it to the same address |

## How it works

Slack sends three kinds of request to the Worker:

| Path | Slack feature | Handles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/slack/events` | Event Subscriptions | Messages: `@Cade …` commands, and plain messages Cade reacts to; opening the Home tab draws the person's dashboard (`src/home.js`) |
| `/slack/interactions` | Interactivity | Forms, buttons and menus |
| `/slack/commands` | Slash Commands | `/cade …` |

Every request is checked against the signing secret first. Slack wants an
answer within three seconds, so slow work runs after the response, through
`waitUntil`.

Most commands are messages that start by mentioning the bot, such as
`@Cade assign @person`, because Slack doesn't allow custom slash commands in
threads and most commands are sent from a thread. Commands that start
something new outside a thread are slash commands, which can open a form
straight away.

    Parse[parse.js: build a command]
    Dispatch[dispatch.js: find handler, check scope]
    Handler[Command handler]
    Reply[Reply, reaction or form]

    Message --> Parse --> Dispatch --> Handler --> Reply
```

Plain messages aren't commands, but some still mean something: a pasted PR
link, a hand-off such as "@rex please look into this", "okay, started
working on this", or "LGTM". These are **intents**. A handler declares its
intents next to its commands, each with the phrases (or a test) that signal
it, what it needs (a thread, a mention), an `order`, and what to do;
`src/intents.js` picks the first that matches. Today there are:

| Order | Intent | In | Signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20 | `work` | `suggest.js` | pull request links (linked, with the people mentioned as reviewers), hand-offs ("@mia can you review this?"), the work starting ("on it"), progress ("LGTM", "QA passed", "done"), read by phrases or with AI |
| 50 | `new-thread` | `move.js` | a message posted on its own in a dev channel, not in a thread |

Each only asks the writer, privately, before changing anything, since a
phrase can match a message that didn't mean it. Questions ("done?") and
hedged messages ("not done yet") don't count as progress.

### Where things are kept

Tasks are stored in D1, the `DB` binding (`db.js`, with the tables in
`migrations/`). A new one is stored before its root message is posted
(`createTask` in `commands/track.js`), with `ts` empty until Slack takes the
post; if Slack refuses it, the cron in `wrangler.toml` posts it again every
five minutes (`retry.js`, through `publishTask`), up to five tries in all.
Once posted, a row is found by its channel and `ts`. `loadTask` and
`saveTask` in `tasks.js` read and write a task; `saveTask` stores the row
first, then renders it to the root message in the dev channel
(`taskMessage`) and to its row in the Google Sheet (`syncTask`). Slack and
the Sheet are only written to, never read back: `/cade tasks` is a query of
open tasks. An incident is a task with `source_incident` set: always urgent
and due immediately. A task's PRs sent to the client with `@Cade release`
are rows of `releases`, one per release, with its PRs and what it
completes; a task is loaded with them (`getTask`), and its message shows
which PRs shipped with which release. Deleted tasks keep their rows, with
`deleted_at` set. Open tasks are pinned, for people to find in Slack.

The `requirements` table, and tasks' `source_channel`, `source_thread_ts`
and `source_link`, are left from when a group could have a client channel,
and are no longer read.

The database isn't named in `wrangler.toml`, so nothing account-specific is
committed: the first `wrangler deploy` creates one for the Worker, named
after it (`<name>-db`), and later deploys reuse it. To change the tables, add
a numbered file to `migrations/`; `npm run deploy` applies it.

### Adding a command

Create a module in `src/commands/` and add it to the list in
`src/commands/registry.js`, whose comment describes the handler shape. A
handler declares its name, how it's used, its help section, and where it may
run (which channels, and whether only in a thread); the dispatcher enforces
these and answers with a hint when a command is used in the wrong place.
Its buttons and forms are registered on the same handler, as `actions` (by
action ID) and `views` (by form callback ID), and so are any `intents`:
to recognise a new kind of message, add an `intent({ … })` to a handler's
`intents` (the comment at the top of `src/intents.js` has the shape), or add
words to an existing list such as `HANDOFFS`. If it needs a new Slack scope
or event, add it to `slack/manifest.json` and run `npm run slack:update`.

## Tests

`npm test` runs `test/index.test.js` against the real Worker, with `fetch`
replaced by a fake Slack API: `mockSlack` returns canned results and records
every call, so tests check exactly what Cade would send. Like Slack, the
fake rejects a message whose buttons share an action ID. Shared fixtures,
such as `storedTask` and `incidentTask`, build the records Cade would have
stored.
