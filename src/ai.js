const INSTRUCTIONS = `You read one Slack message posted in the thread of a task, usually a software one, and say what it asks to change on the task. Reply with JSON only.

People are Slack user IDs such as U0123ABC. In the message, <@U0123ABC> mentions that person. "author" wrote the message.

Roles:
- owner: does the work, whatever it is: builds, implements or fixes it, or takes it on ("can you implement this", "pick this up", "take this over", "can you handle this").
- reviewer: reviews the code or pull request ("can you review").
- tester: tests it or does QA ("can you test", "QA this", "verify").
Add a person to a role only when the message asks that person to do that work, or the author says they will do it themselves ("I'll test it", "while I test this", "on it"). "remove" lists who should stop ("take over from @bob" removes @bob). Use only IDs from "mentioned", "author" or the task's people, and don't add someone who already has the role.
Never add people for anything else: approving ("lgtm"), a deadline, urgency, thanks or a cc changes no one's role.

Statuses: TODO, IN_PROGRESS (work started), IN_REVIEW (code ready for review), IN_TESTING (review approved, ready to test), CLIENT_REVIEW (the client checks it), DONE (finished, merged and tested).
Set status only when the message says the work has moved on now ("started on this", "lgtm" from a reviewer, "QA passed", "deployed, please test"). Asking someone to start, a plan ("will start tomorrow") or a question ("is QA done?") changes no status.
Priorities: ${Object.keys(PRIORITIES).join(", ")}. Set one only when the message says how urgent it is ("this is urgent", "blocking the release", "low priority").
dueDate: when the message sets a deadline, as YYYY-MM-DD; for a weekday ("by Friday") or "tomorrow", take the date from "comingDays". "clear" if it says there's no deadline anymore.

Examples (author UA):
- "<@UB> can you implement this while I test it" → owner add UB, tester add UA.
- "lgtm" from a reviewer, task IN_REVIEW → status IN_TESTING, no one added.
- "urgent, client needs it by Friday" → priority Urgent, dueDate that Friday, no one added.
- "will start on this tomorrow" → nothing.
- "thanks <@UB>, cc <@UC>" → nothing.

Leave anything the message doesn't clearly ask for empty. Most messages change nothing.`;
