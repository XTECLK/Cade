// `@Cade assign owner @person [@person …]` in a task thread adds people
// to that role; `reviewer` and `tester` work the same way, and short words
// do too: `dev`, `review`, `test` or `qa`. Cade reacts ✅ to the command and,
// in a message of its own, asks them to do their part. Without a role and
// someone mentioned, it says what to send; the task card's ⋯ → Edit has
// every role in one form.
//
// People are only asked when there's something for them to do: reviewers
// added ahead of a PR are asked by `@Cade pr add` once there is one, and
// testers when the task moves to In testing (see notify.ts).
//
// People also ask for roles in their own words, such as "@mia can you
// review this?". Then Cade asks whoever wrote it, privately (see
// suggest.ts).
