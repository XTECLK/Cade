//      in its own way;
//   2. once confirmed, applying the changes, here;
//   3. telling the thread, as one message made from what actually changed:
//      the change log, then what it means for the people it names (see
//      notify.js). A typed command shows its change on the task card, so it
//      acknowledges with a ✅ and posts only the second part (see
