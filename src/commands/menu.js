// The ⋯ menu on a task's card (see taskMenu in tasks.js) has up to five
// choices, without a command message in the task's thread:
//   Edit     one form for the people, status, priority and due date (not on
//            an incident, whose are fixed) and pull requests (see edit.js);
//            saving it posts who changed what in the thread, as the record,
//            and the card updates.
//   Release  while the task has PRs not sent yet: the form `@Cade release`
//            opens, to send some of them for approval, a partial release.
//   Export thread  writes the task's thread as text in its own page in the
//            project's Doc, under the Export tab, and tells whoever chose it
//            where (see export.js). Doing it again writes the page over.
//   Archive  archives the task, as `@Cade archive` does (see archive.js),
//            telling its thread who did.
// Anything Cade can't do is said only to whoever chose it. Cards posted
// before had other choices; they open Edit, which has everything.
