// opens a form to pick an open task. Outside a dev channel, with more than
// one group, each form asks for the project too, and Move to existing then
// lists that project's open tasks. The message is copied as above, so it can be read in the task's
// thread even by people who can't see where it was written; the link back
// to it, and the note and reaction under it, work only where they can.

// the same in one click from Slack's hover bar, with a private reply
