// and so does a pasted pull request link. This is the one place messages in a
// thread are read; a message posted on its own in a channel has no task yet
// (see move.js).
// With AI on (`aiSuggestions` in cade.config.json), the message is read with AI, which
// can tell more: see ai-suggest.js. Otherwise, or if AI fails, it's read by
// its phrases, as below; both apply changes the same way (see changes.js).
//
// By phrases:
// "@mia can you review this?", "on it", "lgtm", "done". Cade reads the
// message a request at a time for who it asks to take each role, and what it
// says about the work, then asks whoever wrote it, privately, with the same
// summary AI suggestions give: Accept, Edit… or Reject (see askToChange in
// ai-suggest.js). Nothing changes until then, and the thread hears only what
// changed, credited to them.
//
// Who is asked is whoever the request names ("@rex, can you review this?"),
// so a mention that only informs ("cc @rex") asks no one, and neither does
// the author's own plan ("I'll test it"). Each kind can be turned off with
// `taskStatusChangeDetection` in cade.config.json:
//   pr-links   a pull request link: link it, and ask the people it mentions
//              to review it
//   hand-offs  a request to develop, review or test it: a picker for that role
//   started    the work starting: In progress, and, for someone who isn't on
//              the task, the owners picker
//   progress   a reviewer approving, a tester passing it, or anyone on it
//              saying it's finished: the next status (see progressOptions)
//   details    with AI only: the priority and due date, but not an
//              incident's

// The words that ask for each role (see intents.js for how phrases match).
// Within a request they're checked in this order: "please review this fix"
// asks for a review, not for development.
