// What Cade says in a task's thread when its people, pull requests or
// status change, in one place so they read alike. Each change is one
// message: the record of what changed and who changed it, "<@ann> assigned
// <@rex> as owner.", then on the next line what it means for those it
// names, "<@rex>, could you pick this up when you get a chance? Thanks!".
// The record keeps a log of every change in the thread, and the record's
// mention notifies them anyway, so the request comes with it, in the same
// message, rather than as a ping of its own.
//
// Someone who assigns or removes themselves is named as "themselves", and
// isn't asked or told anything: they made the change. Nor is anyone `told`
// already, by the message a suggested change came from, { [id]: null }: they
// are still named by mention in the change log, but get no request of their
// own, as that message was one.
//
// People are only asked when there's something for them to do now (see
// onTheirPlate): owners while the task is To do or In progress, reviewers
// while it is In review, testers while it is In testing. Someone assigned
// earlier is asked when the task reaches their stage. Those removed are only
// told when they would have been asked.
//
// Every flow and the messages it posts are on the website's
// docs/notifications.html: keep it in step.
